abstract: |  
  This paper investigates the origins and career trajectories of high-skilled workers in electricity-related occupations in Sweden during the mid-20th century. By ingesting and analyzing two unique data sources – a set of biographical dictionaries and an industrial catalogue – I ask where these workers came from, what and where they studied, and how international experience impacted their career paths.

  Jayes, Enflo and Molinder (2024) find that medium-skilled electricity-related jobs were filled by workers who were born near to these jobs. However, descriptive statistics about these high-skilled workers reveal a bifurcated labor market. Highly educated and skilled professionals, crucial in overseeing and advancing the electricity sector, frequently migrated for education and career opportunities, often traveling significant distances from their birthplaces to a small set of higher education institutions in Sweden and abroad. After their studies, Swedish engineers moved to opportunity, ending up on average ten times further from their birthplace than the median worker in 1930. In terms of occupational mobility, we do not see a similar pattern to the middle-skill electricity related jobs among engineers; there is no clear pattern for engineers to have lower status parents than other occupations in the biographical dictionaries.
